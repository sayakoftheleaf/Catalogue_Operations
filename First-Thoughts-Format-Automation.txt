Initial thoughts
-----------------

- Modules
  - Document Merger - Merges multiple documents into one document
    - Data is preserved, sheet names are generated to avoid conflict
    - Hash Table to remember the mapping between the sheets and the original document/sheet combination
  - Merger - merges multiple sheets into one sheet
    - Does no processing, only takes the columns of all the sheets and converts them into the columns of one sheet/
  - Unique Data Check? 
    - Check that all rows in a column contain data of the same kind or are blank
      - Does not apply to images (type check really hard)
    - If not, throw error and ask the user to fix it
  - Create a config file using user input that defines column mappings
    - Allows column renames
    - Allows user to migrate contents of multiple columns into a new column with a separator
      - Allows forced data type conversion?    
      - Convert contents from multiple columns into one column
        - Actual processing, takes the contents of multiple columns, 
        - check if they are of the same data type, if not throw exception
        - migrate contents into the new column, with the desired separator
        - either generate a new file, or add the column to an existing file, depending on user input/




  - Check if a document is in the desired structure
    - If yes, upload
    - If no, throw appropriate errors
      - Throwing appropriate errors is probably going to be the hardest part
